// 1. Enumerable Magic #20 - Cascading Subsets
// Create a method each_cons that accepts a list and a number n, and returns cascading subsets of the list of size n, like so:

// each_cons([1,2,3,4], 2)
//   #=> [[1,2], [2,3], [3,4]]

// each_cons([1,2,3,4], 3)
//   #=> [[1,2,3],[2,3,4]]
  
function eachCons(array, n) {
    let result = [];
  for (let i = 0; i <= array.length - n; i++){
    result.push(array.slice(i, i + n))
  }
	return result;
}

// 2. Sum of differences in array

// Your task is to sum the differences between consecutive pairs in the array in descending order.

// Example
// [2, 1, 10]  -->  9
// In descending order: [10, 2, 1]

// Sum: (10 - 2) + (2 - 1) = 8 + 1 = 9

// If the array is empty or the array has only one element the result should be 0 (Nothing in Haskell, None in Rust).

function sumOfDifferences(arr) {

   if (arr.length <= 1) {
    return 0;
  }

  let sortArr = arr.sort((a, b) => b - a);
  let sum = 0;
  for (let i = 0; i < arr.length - 1; i++){
    sum += sortArr[i] - sortArr[i + 1]
  }
  return sum
}

// 3. Find the first non-consecutive number

// DESCRIPTION:
// Your task is to find the first element of an array that is not consecutive.

// By not consecutive we mean not exactly 1 larger than the previous element of the array.

// E.g. If we have an array [1,2,3,4,6,7,8] then 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 are all consecutive but 6 is not, so that's the first non-consecutive number.

// If the whole array is consecutive then return null2.

// The array will always have at least 2 elements1 and all elements will be numbers. The numbers will also all be unique and in ascending order. The numbers could be positive or negative and the first non-consecutive could be either too!

// If you like this Kata, maybe try this one next: https://www.codewars.com/kata/represent-array-of-numbers-as-ranges

// 1 Can you write a solution that will return null2 for both [] and [ x ] though? (This is an empty array and one with a single number and is not tested for, but you can write your own example test. )

function firstNonConsecutive(arr) {
  for (let i = 1; i < arr.length; i++) {
    if (arr[i] !== arr[i - 1] + 1) {
      return arr[i];
    }
  }
  return null; 
}
