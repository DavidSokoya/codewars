// 3. The museum of incredibly dull things
// The museum of incredibly dull things wants to get rid of some exhibits. Miriam, the interior architect, comes up with a plan to remove the most boring exhibits. She gives them a rating, and then removes the one with the lowest rating.

// However, just as she finished rating all exhibits, she's off to an important fair, so she asks you to write a program that tells her the ratings of the exhibits after removing the lowest one. Fair enough.

// Task
// Given an array of integers, remove the smallest value. Do not mutate the original array/list. If there are multiple elements with the same value, remove the one with the lowest index. If you get an empty array/list, return an empty array/list.
// Don't change the order of the elements that are left.

// 4. Abbreviate a Two Word Name

// 7. Jaden Casing Strings
// Jaden Smith, the son of Will Smith, is the star of films such as The Karate Kid (2010) and After Earth (2013). Jaden is also known for some of his philosophy that he delivers via Twitter. When writing on Twitter, he is known for almost always capitalizing every word. For simplicity, you'll have to capitalize each word, check out how contractions are expected to be in the example below.
// Your task is to convert strings to how they would be written by Jaden Smith. The strings are actual quotes from Jaden Smith, but they are not capitalized in the same way he originally typed them.
// Example:
// Not Jaden-Cased: "How can mirrors be real if our eyes aren't real"
// Jaden-Cased:     "How Can Mirrors Be Real If Our Eyes Aren't Real"
String.prototype.toJadenCase = function () {

// 8. The highest profit wins!

// DESCRIPTION:
// Story
// Ben has a very simple idea to make some profit: he buys something and sells it again. Of course, this wouldn't give him any profit at all if he was simply to buy and sell it at the same price. Instead, he's going to buy it for the lowest possible price and sell it at the highest.

// Task
// Write a function that returns both the minimum and maximum number of the given list/array.

// Examples (Input --> Output)
// [1,2,3,4,5] --> [1,5]
// [2334454,5] --> [5,2334454]
// [1]         --> [1,1]
// Remarks
// All arrays or lists will always have at least one element, so you don't need to check the length. Also, your function will always get an array or a list, you don't have to check for null, undefined or similar.

// If Alex gets 10 or more hoops, return the string "Great, now move on to tricks".
// If he doesn't get 10 hoops, return the string "Keep at it until you get it".

  return n >= 10 ? "Great, now move on to tricks" : "Keep at it until you get it"

// 70 <= score < 80	'C'
// 60 <= score < 70	'D'
// 0 <= score < 60	'F'
