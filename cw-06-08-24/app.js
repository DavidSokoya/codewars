// Is the date today

// Write a simple function that takes as a parameter a date object and returns a boolean value representing whether the date is today or not.

// Make sure that your function does not return a false positive by only checking the day.

function isToday(date) {
  const today = new Date();
  return (
    date.getFullYear() === today.getFullYear() &&
    date.getMonth() === today.getMonth() &&
    date.getDate() === today.getDate()
  );
}

// Days in the year
// A variation of determining leap years, assuming only integers are used and years can be negative and positive.

// Write a function which will return the days in the year and the year entered in a string. For example:

// yearDays(2000) returns "2000 has 366 days"
// There are a few assumptions we will accept the year 0, even though there is no year 0 in the Gregorian Calendar.

// Also the basic rule for validating a leap year are as follows

// Most years that can be divided evenly by 4 are leap years.

// Exception: Century years are NOT leap years UNLESS they can be evenly divided by 400.

// So the years 0, -64 and 2016 will return 366 days. Whilst 1974, -10 and 666 will return 365 days.

function yearDays(year)
{
  
  if ((year % 4 === 0 && year % 100 !== 0) || (year % 400 === 0 && year % 100 === 0) ) {
    return `${year} has 366 days`
  } else {
    return `${year} has 365 days`
  }
}

// Remove the time
// Task Description
// You're re-designing a blog, and the blog's posts have the Weekday Month Day, time format for showing the date and time when a post was made, e.g., Friday May 2, 7pm.

// You're running out of screen real estate, and on some pages you want to display a shorter format, Weekday Month Day that omits the time.

// Write a function that takes the website date/time in its original string format and returns the shortened format.

// Input
// Input will always be a string, e.g., "Friday May 2, 7pm". 

// Output
// Output will be the shortened string, e.g., "Friday May 2".

function shortenToDate(longDate) {
  return longDate.slice(0, longDate.indexOf(','))
